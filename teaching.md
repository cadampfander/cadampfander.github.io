<h1>Teaching</h1>

<p>My philosophy of teaching is to encourage students to grapple with the material directly. In class, I prioritize guided practice my preparing worksheets; I encourage discussion and debate of novel topics by circulating news articles and podcasts. Definitions, formulas, and memorization are best left for textbooks at home. When I do lecture, I emphasize the motivation underlying each formula, to impart an intuitive understanding of the material. My approach encourages students to view the wider world through the lens of economics, to apply course material to their everyday lives.</p>

<p>Below I link my teaching evaluations for my two semesters of teaching experience:</p>
