<h2><a href="papers/Pfander_JMP.pdf">Trade and the Competition for Transport: How (a lack of) Competition in the Transporation Sector Affects Regional Trade Outcomes (Job Market Paper)</a></h2>
<p>This paper seeks to understand how market structure for freight transportation affects domestic trade outcomes. I modify a standard Ricardian trade model to incorporate imperfectly-collusive transporters spanning multiple modes. Estimating the model's fundamentals reveals the expected per-mile iceberg trade cost for specific modes, the correlation of trade costs across disparate markets, and the ferocity of competition for freight transportation along individual segments of the domestic transit network. Calibrating the model to domestic trade flows, I find that: i) current losses due to non-competitive pricing are substantial, amounting to roughly 5% of baseline welfare; ii) the exercise of freight market power has an outsize impact on exports; iii) these impacts are concentrated in rural areas throughout the Southeast and Mountain West, as well as small urban areas in the Midwest and Gulf states; iv) exercise of freight market power exacerbates the impact of mode-specific shocks; and v) non-competitive freight pricing does little to attenuate international trade shocks, due to the concentration of freight market power away from international gates.</p>
