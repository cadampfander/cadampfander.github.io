<h2><a href="papers/Pfander_JMP.pdf">Trade and the Competition for Transport: How (a lack of) Competition in the Transporation Sector Affects Regional Trade Outcomes (Job Market Paper)</a></h2>
<p>This paper seeks to understand how market structure for freight transportation affects domestic trade outcomes. I modify a standard Ricardian trade model to incorporate imperfectly-collusive transporters spanning multiple modes. Estimating the model's fundamentals reveals the expected per-mile iceberg trade cost for specific modes, the correlation of trade costs across disparate markets, and the ferocity of competition for freight transportation along individual segments of the domestic transit network. Calibrating the model to domestic trade flows, I find that: i) current losses due to non-competitive pricing are substantial, amounting to roughly 5% of baseline welfare; ii) the exercise of freight market power has an outsize impact on exports; iii) these impacts are concentrated in rural areas throughout the Southeast and Mountain West, as well as small urban areas in the Midwest and Gulf states; iv) exercise of freight market power exacerbates the impact of mode-specific shocks; and v) non-competitive freight pricing does little to attenuate international trade shocks, due to the concentration of freight market power away from international gates.</p>

<h2>Establishment Mobility Within Firm: Exploring the Composition and Consequences of a Novel Channel of Worker Mobility</h2>
<i>with Jeronimo Carballo and Richard Mansfield</i>
<p>Multi-establishment firms account for ∼60% of U.S. workers’ primary employers, providing ample opportunity for workers to change their work location without changing their employer. Using U.S. matched employer-employee data from 2003-2014, this paper analyzes workers’ scope for and use of such within-firm job transitions, and estimates the effect on workers’ earnings growth of greater scope, as measured by proximity of employment at other within-firm establishments. While establishment transitions are not perfectly observed, we find that at least 0.8% of workers change establishments within firms each year (1.2% among those at risk), and estimate that another 0.3% of workers make unobserved transitions. Taken together, we estimate that within-firm establishment transitions account for 8.3% percent of all job transitions by American workers. While within-firm establishment transitions are common in nearly every worker and firm subpopulation we can examine, they are particularly frequent (closer to 2% of workers) at the largest and highest paying firms and among the highest paid workers. Such transitions are also considerably more likely than between-firm transitions to feature long distances between origin and destination establishment, suggesting that combined benefits for workers and firms from establishment reallocation must be sufficiently large to overcome substantial moving costs. Using variation in worker’s establishment locations within their firms’ establishment network, we show that having a greater share of the firm’s jobs in nearby locations within the firm generates meaningful increases in worker’s earnings: a worker at the 90th percentile of earnings gains from more proximate within-firm job opportunities can expect to enjoy 2% higher average earnings over the following five years than a worker at the 10th percentile with the same baseline earnings. The results are robust to various checks for a variety of potential sorting biases and functional forms.</p>
