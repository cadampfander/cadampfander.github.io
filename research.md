<h2>Trade and the Competition for Transport: How (a lack of) Competition in the Transporation Sector Affects Regional Trae Outcomes (Job Market Paper)</h2>
<p>This paper seeks to understand how market structure for freight transportation affects domestic trade outcomes. I modify a standard Ricardian trade model to incorporate imperfectly-collusive transporters spanning multiple modes. Estimating the model's fundamentals reveals the expected per-mile iceberg trade cost for specific modes, the correlation of trade costs across disparate markets, and the ferocity of competition for freight transportation along individual segments of the domestic transit network. Calibrating the model to domestic trade flows, I find that: i) current losses due to non-competitive pricing are substantial, amounting to as much as 2\% of U.S. GDP and suppressing international trade by as much as 70\%; ii) these losses are concentrated in the Midwest, Southeast, and in urban centers aong the West Coast; iii) due to incomplete pass-through, imperfect freight competition mitigates the welfare impacts of exogenous shocks; iv) non-competitive markups genreate more geographically uniform impacts from exogenous shocks; and v) imperfect freight competition exacerbates the trade impacts international shocks.</p>
