<h2>Trade and the Competition for Transport: How (a lack of) Competition in the Transporation Sector Affects Regional Trae Outcomes (Job Market Paper)</h2>
<p>This paper seeks to understand how market structure for freight transportation affects domestic trade outcomes. I modify a standard Ricardian trade model to incorporate imperfectly-collusive transporters spanning multiple modes. Estimating the model's fundamentals reveals the expected per-mile iceberg trade cost for specific modes, the correlation of trade costs across disparate markets, and the ferocity of competition for freight transportation along individual segments of the domestic transit network.Calibrating the model to domestic trade flows, I find that: i) current losses due to non-competitive pricing are substantial, amounting to as much as 1.7\% of U.S. GDP; ii) these losses are concentrated among rural areas, with the worst-affected areas loosing as much as 15\% of their annual GDP; and iii) this concentration of market power generates imperfect pass-through of exogenous cost shocks to the consumer: consumers realize less benefit from domestic infrastructure benefit, but are shielded from an international trade shock.</p>
