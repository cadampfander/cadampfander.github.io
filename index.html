<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>I am Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I will be available at the 2024 ASSA meetings in San Antonio, TX.</p>
<br>
<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p> My primary research fields are International Trade, Industrial Organization, and Economic History. My research focuses on the consequences of concentration in markets for factor mobility, and incorporates a variety of structural, reduced-form, and computational methodologies. Specifically, I investigate the regional trade consequences of price collusion in domestic freight markets; how increasing monopsony power in the labor market can be welfare-enhancing; and how historical concentrations of freight market power shaped North America's economic development in the 20th and 21st Centuries.
